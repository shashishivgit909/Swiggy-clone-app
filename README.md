# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. Caret: in react icon : ^ or something in this shape  , but icon is made by gpg so comes down :  It also comes under font 

2. Understanding Event Bubbling
Event bubbling is a mechanism in the DOM where an event starts from the deepest target element and then propagates upward to its parent elements. In your case:

Parent <div>: Has an onClick handler (hideSideBar).
Child <div>: Nested inside the parent without its own onClick handler.

=> The issue you're encountering is happening because when you click on the inner <div>, the click event propagates (or "bubbles") up to the parent <div>, triggering the onClick handler on the parent (which calls hideSideBar). This behavior is part of JavaScript's event bubbling mechanism.

To prevent the click event on the inner <div> from bubbling up to the parent, you need to use event.stopPropagation() in the onClick handler of the inner <div>. This will stop the click event from reaching the parent element.



eg: code : <div
  className="black-overlays w-full h-full fixed duration-500"
  onClick={hideSideBar}
  style={{
    opacity: toggle ? 1 : 0,
    visibility: toggle ? "visible" : "hidden",
  }}
>
  <div
    className="w-[400px] h-[500px] bg-white absolute duration-[400ms] border-4 border-black"
    style={{
      left: toggle ? '0%' : '-100%',
    }}
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.stopPropagation(); // Prevent event bubbling
    }}
  >
    {/* Inner div content */}
  </div>
</div>


###   difference between e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault()
=>
e.stopPropagation(): This method stops the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. This is exactly what you need in your case to prevent the onClick event on the inner <div> from triggering the onClick event on the parent <div>.

e.preventDefault(): This method prevents the default action that belongs to the event from happening. For example, it can prevent a link from navigating, a form from submitting, or a checkbox from being checked. It doesn't stop the event from bubbling up the DOM tree.

In your scenario, you want to prevent the click event from propagating to the parent element, so e.stopPropagation() is the appropriate method to use. e.prevent
